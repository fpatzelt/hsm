    To provide the State Pattern-like behavior, the formal state machine rules
    may be slightly broken, and instead of creating an `internal transition
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine #Internal_transitions>`_
    for every action that doesn't require a state change, event handlers may be
    added to states. These are handled first when an event occurs. After that
    the actual transition is called, calling `enter`/`exit` actions and other
    transition actions. Nevertheless, internal transitions are also supported.

    So the order of calls on an event is as follows:

        1. State's event handler
        2. `condition` callback
        3. `before` callback
        4. `exit` handlers
        5. `action` callback
        6. `enter` handlers
        7. `after` callback

    If there's no handler in states or transition for an event, it is silently
    ignored.

    If using nested state machines, all events should be sent to the root state
    machine.

    **Attributes:**

        .. attribute:: state

            Current, local state (instance of |State|) in a state machine.

        .. attribute:: stack

            Stack that can be used if the `Pushdown Automaton (PDA)
            <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton>`_ functionality
            is needed.

        .. attribute:: state_stack

            Stack of previous local states in a state machine. With every
            transition, a previous state (instance of |State|) is pushed to the
            `state_stack`. Only :attr:`.StateMachine.STACK_SIZE` (32
            by default) are stored and old values are removed from the stack.

        .. attribute:: leaf_state_stack

            Stack of previous leaf states in a state machine. With every
            transition, a previous leaf state (instance of |State|) is pushed
            to the `leaf_state_stack`. Only
            :attr:`.StateMachine.STACK_SIZE` (32 by default) are
            stored and old values are removed from the stack.

        **leaf_state**
            See the :attr:`~.StateMachine.leaf_state` property.

        **root**
            See the :attr:`~.StateMachine.root` property.

    :param name: Human readable state machine name
    :type name: str

    .. note ::

        |StateMachine| extends |State| and therefore it is possible to always
        use a |StateMachine| instance instead of the |State|. This wouldn't
        be a good practice though, as the |State| class is designed to be as
        small as possible memory-wise and thus it's more memory efficient. It
        is valid to replace a |State| with a |StateMachine| later on if there's
        a need to extend a state with internal states.

    .. note::

        For the sake of speed thread safety isn't guaranteed.

    **Example Usage:**

    .. code-block:: python

        state_machine = StateMachine('root')
        state_on = State('On')
        state_off = State('Off')
